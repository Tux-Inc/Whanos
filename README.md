# Whanos ðŸ¦„
Don't let your applications be snapped by Thanos ðŸ«°
## Introduction
### What is Whanos?
Whanos is a tool that allows you to easily Dockerize your applications and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster. It uses a Jenkins instance to build and push the Docker images to a private Docker registry and a Helm chart to deploy the applications to the Kubernetes cluster.

### Goals
- Easily deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster
- Easily build and push Docker images to a private Docker registry

The mail goal of Whanos is for a developer to focus on the application code and not on the infrastructure.

By simply starting a Jenkins job, the developer will be able to Dockerize his application. 

If the developer want to deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster, he will simply have to add a file called `whanos.yaml` to the root of his project and start a Jenkins job. Whanos will take care of building the Docker image, pushing it to the private Docker registry and deploying the application to the Kubernetes cluster.
